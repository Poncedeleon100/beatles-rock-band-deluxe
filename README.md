*NOTE: The Beatles: Rock Band Deluxe on PS3/RPCS3 installs differently compared to the other Deluxe projects.*

## Installing on Xbox 360

* **Install your vanilla copy of The Beatles: Rock Band** to your console's hard drive.

* Download [**The Beatles: Rock Band Deluxe for Xbox 360**](https://nightly.link/hmxmilohax/beatles-rock-band-deluxe/workflows/build/main/TBRBDX-Xbox.zip).

## Installing on Xenia

### ***WARNING: THE BEATLES: ROCK BAND IS UNPLAYABLE ON XENIA AND IS USED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PURPOSES ONLY!!!***

*Follow [**Repo Setup (Advanced)**](#repo-setup-advanced) first in order to properly follow this guide.*

* **Extract your vanilla copy of The Beatles: Rock Band** and copy the contents of the `gen` folder to `\_build\xbox\gen\`.

* Navigate to `_xenia` and **map your controller with x360ce**.
  * When it asks you to create `xinput1_3.dll`, create it and **rename it to `xinput1_4.dll`**.

* Then, **navigate to `windows_bats`** if you're on Windows or **`user_scripts`** if you're on Linux and **run `build_xenia` to automatically update, build, and run The Beatles: Rock Band Deluxe.**
  * *You need to run this script every time in order to play and update the game. `run_xenia` will run the game only and won't update and build it unless a new update is available, so you can use that if `build_xenia` takes too long.*

***The Beatles: Rock Band Deluxe is now installed!***

***Sidenote:*** *if you're experiencing issues regarding character models, navigate to `_xenia`, open `xenia-canary.config.toml` in your text editor of choice, and change `gpu` from `vulkan` to `d3d12` and `d3d12_readback_resolve` from `false` to `true` (you may need to press `CTRL + F` to find these). This will fix all texture issues but will drastically affect the framerate, you also may experience BSODs. If you don't want to deal with any of this, we recommend using* [***RPCS3***](#installing-on-rpcs3-recommended-for-pc) *instead.*

# Optional Upgrades

*These are some optional, but very handy additions you can make to your The Beatles: Rock Band Deluxe installation.*

## Custom Textures

The Beatles: Rock Band Deluxe has a variety of custom textures, found in the `Deluxe Settings` menu in-game, as well as a way to import your own with relative ease.

### Importing Your Own Textures

*Follow [**Repo Setup (Advanced)**](#repo-setup-advanced) first in order to properly follow this guide.*

* Copy any `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.bmp` file into `\custom_textures\***\`, then navigate back to `windows_bats` and run `process_textures_***.bat`.
  * These will make them show up in game, resize your images accordingly (including those with arbitrary resolutions), and convert them to the proper format for The Beatles: Rock Band Deluxe to read.

***You will need to rebuild The Beatles: Rock Band Deluxe in order for these to take effect.***

# Repo Setup (Advanced)

### Installing Required Dependencies

* Install [**Git for Windows**](https://gitforwindows.org/), [**Dot Net 6.0 Runtime**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime), and [**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.9 or later).
  * Install **Git** and **Dot Net 6.0 Runtime** with their default options, and ***select "Add python.exe to PATH"*** on the **Python** installer.

![Python PATH](dependencies/images/pythonpath.png)

* Open a **new command prompt** (press `Win+R`, type `cmd` and press Enter), type in `pip install gitpython`, and press enter. Close the command prompt when it's done installing.

### Initializing the Repo

* Go to the **[Releases](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/beatles-rock-band-deluxe/releases)** of this repo and **download `_init_repo.bat`** if you're on Windows or **`_init_repo.sh`** if you're on Linux.
  * Make a new **empty** folder, **put `_init_repo` in the folder, and run it**. This will pull the repo down for you and make sure you're completely up to date. **This will take some time.**

### ***The folder should look like this once it's done:***
